_pronounced "**scr**een **c**o**py**"_

This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via
USB or [over TCP/IP](doc/connection.md#tcpip-wireless), and allows to control the
device with the keyboard and the mouse of the computer. It does not require any
_root_ access. It works on _Linux_, _Windows_ and _macOS_.
